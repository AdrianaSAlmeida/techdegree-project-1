This project will be a profile to share with your peers and display in your portfolio, so follow these recommendations to make it look awesome.

Create or choose an image that best represents you for the main profile image. Here are a few suggestions:

A headshot or illustration of you
A photo of a pet
A photo of where your live
Create or choose a second larger image for the background of your profile header. Here are some suggestions:

A photo of your city
A photo of your workstation
A pattern you designed
Be aware of file size: Keep the profile image under 400 KB and the background image under 1 MB (see the link in the project resources section to Picresize, an online image resizing tool).

Once you've set up the project, feel free to explore the project files, get familiar with the code and see many of the concepts you've learned being used in a real-world project. 
As you learn new concepts, take a moment to think about some of the ways you could use what you learned in your project.
